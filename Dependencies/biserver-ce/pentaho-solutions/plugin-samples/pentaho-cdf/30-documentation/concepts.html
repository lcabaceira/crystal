		<h2>Concepts</h2>
		<p>
		
		This framework provides a standardized way to implement and publish dashboards to the Pentaho BI Platform.&nbsp
		The main goal of this framework is to give the user an <b> easy and friendly way to build dashboards.</b>. 
		<br>How can this be achieved?
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>No need to create additional JSP pages to deliver new dashboards.</li>
			<p>The user has no need to make jsp pages or even have the knowledge to deal with that kind of technology.</p>
			
			<li>Easy to design</li>
			<p>It's all plain html, css and javascript</p>
			
			<li>No need to create pentaho Action Sequences. </li>
			<p>On most cases, the components are configured using a friendly syntax.</b></p>
			
			<li>The dashboard objects can be easy reused.</li>
			<p>The behaviors of dashboard objects (components) are related to their parameters values, and so
			the user may use the same object on an different dashboard, modifying only the values 
			of one or two parameters.</p>
			
			<li>Auto refresh and interaction between dashboard objects.</li>
			<p>The user doesn't need to concern about interaction between components. The only thing 
			the user must specify is what variable is bound to the object.</p>
			
			<li>The ability to auto generate a navigation bar that picks up new dashboards.</li>
			<p>A new dashboard was added? No need do modify the menu, the navigation bar will
			deal and present the new one.</p>
			
			<li>New form objects, timeplot charts, tooltips, openstreet maps integration, etc, that makes the dashboard richer. </li>
			<p>What is need to get all this new stuff to work? Just add the desired component.</p>
			
			<li>Build your one dashboard component library.</li>
			<p>When a particular component with a specific behavior is being used in all your projects,<br/> 
			just add it to your javascript library for later use.</p>
			
		</ul>
		
		<p>Beyond this, the are other technical advantages that this framework brings to pentaho dashboard:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Enforces security via Pentaho's security model.</li>
			<li>Separation of the html design and component definition.</li>
			<li>Portlet integration.</li>
		</ul>
