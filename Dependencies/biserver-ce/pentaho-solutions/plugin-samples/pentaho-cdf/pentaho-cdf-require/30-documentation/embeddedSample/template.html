    <h2>CDF Embedded Example</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p> Loads CDF require configs from a server and renders a new Dashboard with a Select Component. </p>
    <p> It also allows to add custom require modules and load them along with the CDF modules. </p>
    <p> This will make it possible for any server and/or 3rd party applications to embed CDF Dashboards, from a Pentaho Server.</p>

    <h3>Configurations</h3>

    <dl class="documentation">
      <dt>script tag</dt>
      <dd>The url for the server endpoint that injects the CDF dependencies</dd>
    </dl>

    <br>
    <p>To demonstrate the embedding capabilities of CDF, we have an embedded.html file (located in the same folder), which is is capable of embedding CDF.<br>
    This is done by simply including a javascript resource, which will make sure to embed the necessary files.<br>
    You can drop te embedded.html file into any web server and you'll be able to embed a CDF dashboard, as long as you provide the correct url for the script tag mentioned below.
    </p>

    <p>You really only need to know the path to the Pentaho Server from which you want to embed CDF, and then include the embed javascript resource:</p>
    <pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/server/pentaho/plugin/pentaho-cdf/api/cdf-embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre><br>
    <p>Our embedded.html demonstrates this:</p>
    <p>ln12:</p> <pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://localhost:8080/pentaho/plugin/pentaho-cdf/api/cdf-embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
    <br>
    <p>We can then assume we are in a Pentaho CDF environment, we are embedded!</p>
    <p>ln54:</p>
    <pre>
      require(['cdf/Dashboard.Blueprint', 'cdf/components/SelectComponent', 'myModule', "cdf/Logger"],
        function(Dashboard, SelectComponent, m, Logger) {
          
        Logger.log("MODULE getString() " + m.getString());
        m.writeOnElement("#myModuleText", "Text written by a custom module defined in myModule.js");

        var myDashboard = new Dashboard();

        myDashboard.addParameter("region", "1");

        var selectComponent = new SelectComponent({
          name: "regionSelector",
          type: "select",
          parameters: [],
          valuesArray: [["1", "Lisbon"], ["2", "Dusseldorf"]],
          parameter: "region",
          valueAsId: false,
          htmlObject: "sampleObject",
          executeAtStart: true,
          postChange: function() {
            alert("You chose: " + myDashboard.getParameterValue(this.parameter));
          }
        });

        myDashboard.addComponent(selectComponent);
        myDashboard.init();
      });
    </pre>
    <p>Note that myModule is not configured in CDF, hence requireJS will try to get its definition from a file named myModule.js in the same path as the embedded.html file.</p>
    <p>In order to properly check this sample, please download the following file from the Pentaho Repository.</p>
    <pre>
      /Public/plugin-samples/CDF/Require Samples/Documentation/embeddedSample/embedded.html
    </pre>
    <p>For instance, in an Apache Server, copy this file to its content root directory and in the browser open http://localhost/embedded.html</p>
