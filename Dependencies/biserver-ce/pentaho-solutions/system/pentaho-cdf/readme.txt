DESCRIPTION
-----------------

This sub-project of CDF is designed as a Pentaho Platform 2.1 plugin.  See
the following doc for plugin API details:

http://wiki.pentaho.com/display/ServerDoc2x/BI+Platform+Plugins+in+V2

The goal of this project is to have CDF be a runtime drop-in to the BI Platform,
with zero changes to the webapp.

BUILD AND INSTALL
-----------------

To build dist/pentaho-cdf.zip, dist/pentaho-cdf-solution.zip and 
dist/pentaho-cdf-samples.zip, run "ant dist".

The plugin must be installed in the pentaho-solutions/system/pentaho-cdf folder.

In order for the MetaLayer to be functional, you must install the pentaho-cdf 
solution folder "cdf" within pentaho-solutions.  Note that at this time there are 
some security implications, so it does not come installed by default.


IMPORTANT NOTE
-----------------

Hibernate SchemaUpdate doesn't create the index on page automatically per
http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-1012 . If you
have lots of comments generated by the CDF commentComponent you may want to
create that index in the cdf_comments table, page column


XCDF File Format
----------------
The XCDF file format is XML, and contains a root element "cdf".  The child 
elements supported are:

title       - the Title displayed in the Pentaho User Console
author      - the Author displayed in the Pentaho User Console
description - the Discription displayed in the Pentaho User Console
icon        - the Icon displayed in the Pentaho User Console
template    - the html template file to render, this contains the CDF widgets.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<cdf>
	<title>Dashboard Title</title>
	<author>CDF Developer</author>
	<description>A Dashboard</description>
	<icon></icon>
	<template>mycdftemplate.html</template>

- I18N .xcdf files 
- incorporate patched chart changes to the platform.
