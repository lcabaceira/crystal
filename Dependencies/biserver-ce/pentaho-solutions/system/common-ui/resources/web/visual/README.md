# Visualization API 3 - experimental

This folder contains the code and documentation of the experimental Visualization API, version 3.
The classes and interfaces here contained and described **may change** when and if they are finally released.

## Visualization changes

This version introduces breaking changes to the code of visualizations, 
and so version 2 visualizations must be converted to work in version 3.

## Experimental period

During the experimental period, 
all stock version 3 visualizations have their ids and names prefixed with "x-" and "X - ", respectively.

For example, the CCC bar chart version 3 visualization is available 
under the id "x-ccc_bar" and shows up in a menu as "X - Bar".

Also, all version 3 visualizations are disabled by default, for Analyzer.
You can enable these by editing the `resources/web/visual/config.js` file.

## Feedback

Please help improve the Visualization API
by providing feedback on this experimental version.
