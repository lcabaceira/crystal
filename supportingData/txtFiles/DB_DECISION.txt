Database requirements can be estimated as follows:

 - Number of spaces: 100,000 (S = attributes = standard + custom)

 - Number of documents: 250,000 (D = attributes = standard + custom)

 - No aspect

 

Number of database records:

 

 - node = spaces + documents

 - node_properties = (spaces * S) + (documents * D)

 - node_status = spaces + documents

 - node_child_assoc = number of Aspects. If the UI weren't being used, then these could be disabled.

 - permission = (permission will be set at the folder level and inherited) = number of documents

 

This would give you the number of records, assume 5K each, and you have an approximate size.
